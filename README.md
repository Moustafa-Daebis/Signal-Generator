# Signal-Generator
General signal generator. The program can be used to generate a signal of one or more different functions involving zero or more breakpoints across the time domain .The signal available are sinusoidal signals ,DC signals, general order polynomial , exponential signal and ramp signal. Several  operations can be performed on the generated signal including  Amplitude Scaling, Time reversal, Time shift, signal expansion and signal compression. 
The codes makes use of a commandline input through which the user is able to naviagiate the signalgenerator.The user is required to enter the time domain of the signal they wish to produce followed by the number of break points.The user is then required to provide the type of signals between the breakpoints ,if there is, along with the properties of these signals such that it can be produced.The signal is then plotted and the user can perform the operations on it.
