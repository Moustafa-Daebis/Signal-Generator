# Signal-Generator
General signal generator. The program can be used to generate a signal of one or more different functions involving zero or more breakpoints across the time domain .The signal available are sinusoidal signals ,DC signals, general order polynomial , exponential signal and ramp signal. Several  operations can be performed on the generated signal including  Amplitude Scaling, Time reversal, Time shift, signal expansion and signal compression.
